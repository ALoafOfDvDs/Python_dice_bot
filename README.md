# dice.py
This file uses the numpy library to create a pseudorandom number generator that has been adapted to imitate rolling a die. The valid different dice are {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100}. 
The bot is called by having "/roll" being at the very beginning of a message sent in discord where the bot can see it.
